Example 1: 2018121490624 A math problem for analytic geometry  
Let F_1 be the left focus of ellipse C:x^2/a^2+y^2/b^2=1(a>b>0), Point M lies on C, and MF_1 is perpendicular to the X-axis, if |MF_1|=3/2, the eccentricity of ellipse C is 1/2.
 (1) Find the standard equation of ellipse C. 
(2) If the left vertex of ellipse C is point A, and the right vertex of △ABD is point A, AB intersects ellipse C at B, and AD intersects ellipse C at D. Find the maximum value of area of △ABD.
